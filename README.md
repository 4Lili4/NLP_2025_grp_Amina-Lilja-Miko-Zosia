## Running the code
To install the required libraries in a new environment, open your Anaconda prompt and direct to this repository. Then paste and run the following:
```
conda env create -f requirements.yml
```

## Contents of folders and files
The repository contains 5 folders and 3 front-page files: 
 - baseline_and_project_proposal contains our previous submissions of baseline results, project proposal and project proposal presentation
 - data-files_and_results contains all our csv- and text-files with the data from both WikiAnn and fewnerd. Any files created during the process also land in that folder
 - python_files contains all our final code that we use to get our results. The code is formatted into python-functions, that are run from the Main.IPYNB notebook.
 - WIP_notebooks and WIP_notes_and_inspiration contain are work-in-progress files and considerations. That means all working notebooks, dataset articles etc., are in those folders.

 - The Main.IPYNB is the jupyter notebook through which all our final code can be run. It pulls functions from python-files, and lets you centralize the entire project's final code results.
 - README.md is self-explanatory - you're reading me ;-)
 - Lastly, requirements.yml is our environment-file, and it contains all dependencies. It is made to be run through conda, if you use pip, you may need to convert the dependencies to a .txt-file instead.
